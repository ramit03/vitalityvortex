This repository contains the code for a practice blog project, designed to help me familiarize myself with using a Content Management System (CMS), specifically Sanity. The project aims to demonstrate the integration of a modern CMS into a blog platform, showcasing how content can be managed and displayed dynamically.

## Technologies Used:
 1: Nextjs for the frontend
 2: TailwindCss for the styling and typography
 3: Sanity.io for managing and delivering content
